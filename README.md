# Portfolio-Markowitz
Creation of an Efficiency Frontier based on Markowitz's theory of portfolio diversification. 

For this project as an example, several funds for the Argentinian Market were used to establish the efficiency frontier and example portfolios formed by the funds mentioned above. 

These Portfolios are divided into short, mid, and long-term funds.
