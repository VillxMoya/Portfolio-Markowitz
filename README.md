# Portfolio-Markowitz
Using the tools provided by Markowitz's theory of portfolio diversification, creation of an Efficiency Frontier for which to select the ideal porfolio for the client financial needs.

For this project as an example, several funds for the Argentinian Market were used to establish the efficiency frontier and example portfolios formed by the funds mentioned above. These Portfolios are divided into short, mid, and long-term funds. 

Currently working on updating the methology and switch from Markowitz to Black-Litterman to introduce tracking error contraints.
